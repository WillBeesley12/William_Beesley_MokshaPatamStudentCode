| September 3 | 8-9:40pm | First, I spent some time really thinking about the problem. I am pretty sure that I am going to try to use some sort of search in order to find the optimal ladders to take. From there, I decided to make a first version where I would always take the first ladder. I unfortunately had to spend a lot of time fixing some issues with the IDE (junit). I should know how to do that from now on because it took wayyy too long. Afterwards I had some issues sorting the list because I was using the wrong methods. That burned even more time so I couldn't finish my first implementation unfortunately, but I should be ready to go for tomorrow.  |
