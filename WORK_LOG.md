| September 3 |   8-9:40pm    | First, I spent some time really thinking about the problem. I am pretty sure that I am going to try to use some sort of search in order to find the optimal ladders to take. From there, I decided to make a first version where I would always take the first ladder. I unfortunately had to spend a lot of time fixing some issues with the IDE (junit). I should know how to do that from now on because it took wayyy too long. Afterwards I had some issues sorting the list because I was using the wrong methods. That burned even more time so I couldn't finish my first implementation unfortunately, but I should be ready to go for tomorrow. |

I did this by first initializing the dictionary/map that I would use as my graph, and then I began to add the vertexes and edges to the graph. This took me some time as I had to get used to the initializations and different graph related functions in java. (I have only used dictionaries in python before). After that, I realized that I wanted to make another dictionary of the chutes and ladders, so I circled back to do that as it would make my code more efficient later on and a bit easier to understand. |
