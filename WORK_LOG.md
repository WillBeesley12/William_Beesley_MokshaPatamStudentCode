I am pretty sure that I am going to try to use some sort of search in order to find the optimal ladders to take. From there, I decided to make a first version where I would always take the first ladder. I unfortunately had to spend a lot of time fixing some issues with the IDE (junit). I should know how to do that from now on because it took wayyy too long. Afterwards I had some issues sorting the list because I was using the wrong methods. That burned even more time so I couldn't finish my first implementation unfortunately, but I should be ready to go for tomorrow. |

I did this by first initializing the dictionary/map that I would use as my graph, and then I began to add the vertexes and edges to the graph. This took me some time as I had to get used to the initializations and different graph related functions in java. (I have only used dictionaries in python before). After that, I realized that I wanted to make another dictionary of the chutes and ladders, so I circled back to do that as it would make my code more efficient later on and a bit easier to understand. |
| September 6 |  10:15-11 am  | I finished initializing the graph. It was more complicated than I thought, as I had to introduce a variable to make sure it wouldn't exceed the boardsize. I also had to find a way to check if the number I was currently using existed in either a chute or ladder. finally, I did some testing to make sure the graph functioned properly by giving it the test case that we did in class (board of size 10). From there, I realized that repeat vertices were being added to the same ArrayList, and I had to go back and fix that. Also, the dictionary chutes_ladders had an issue as well, as the node 8 would show up too many times instead of 2. This troubleshooting took a while as well. I eventually realized that I had mistakenly called ladders instead of snakes when initializing my first dictionary. I also realized that some nodes that shouldn't exist were being created (foot of the ladder or top of the snake) so I had to get rid of those as well. |
